The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `:hover` pseudo-class on a nested element doesn't work as expected due to specificity issues:

```css
.outer {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.outer:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.outer .inner {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.outer .inner:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This is not working */
}
```

The expected behavior is that the inner element's background changes to lightgreen on hover.  However, because the `.outer:hover` selector is more specific, it overrides the `.outer .inner:hover` selector, resulting in no visual change on hover for the inner element.
